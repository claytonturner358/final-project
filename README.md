# Ancient Metagenomics Application

**Overview:**
This application conducts metagenomic analysis on DNA sequences using Fasta formatted files. The analysis is conducted with Kraken 2, a taxonomic classification system that uses k-mer matches to achieve accuracy and classification. You can learn more about Kraken 2 here: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/
This application produces reports containing information on percentages, reads assigned to clade, reads assigned directly, taxonomic level, and taxon name.  

**Instructions:** 
This application is meant to be used with Google Colab and Google Drive.
•	Open in Colab.
•	Download the minikraken2_v2_8GB_201904.tgz database to your Google Drive.
•	Run the application.
•	Give Colab permission to access Google Drive if necessary to load the minikraken2_v2_8GB_201904.tgz database. (This step may take a      few minutes)
•	Upload desired FASTA file when prompted.
•	View the report when finished. (I recommend viewing the formatted_report.txt in MS Excel)
